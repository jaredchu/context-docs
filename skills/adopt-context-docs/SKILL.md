# Adopt Context Docs

Apply the sibling [context-docs skill](../context-docs/SKILL.md)
to the current project and establish ongoing use. Read that skill first; it owns
the maintenance method. If unavailable, report the missing dependency rather than
silently inventing a substitute.

Read the project's instructions and entry points. Confirm the target from the
workspace; ask only when the intended project is ambiguous. Initialize missing
context or maintain existing documents using the skill. Preserve useful layouts,
approved decisions, rationale, source evidence, unresolved work and concurrent edits.
Do not manufacture missing intent or populate empty templates merely for completeness.

Add or update a concise rule in the instruction file this project's agent actually
loads, merging with existing guidance rather than duplicating it. Identify that
file from the project rather than assuming one name: `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
are both common, and some clients load only one of them by default. When the
project keeps several, add the rule to the one in effect and make it reachable
from the others by their supported reference or import, instead of maintaining
separate copies. A rule placed in an unloaded file silently does nothing.
Adapt this wording to local terms and to how this client invokes skills:

> Use the context-docs skill for documentation audits and after meaningful changes
> to project facts, decisions, procedures, blockers or next actions. Read the skill
> before maintenance. Preserve project rules, document roles and decision status.
> Update affected canonical sections and check the diff, links and information
> preservation. Keep audit-only requests read-only; make no bookkeeping edits
> when nothing durable changed.

Reuse the installed skills; do not create duplicate packages or change global
instructions. If the user requests audit-only, report adoption recommendations
without editing instruction files or documents. Existing equivalent setup
may require no changes. This workflow adds no authority to publish, deploy or
schedule work; follow the project's existing authorization.

Review the resulting diff, affected links and information preservation before
recording adoption. Once the setup is complete, add or reuse one small marker beside
the maintenance rule in that instruction file:

```text
Method: context-docs
Adopted: YYYY-MM-DD
Entry point: path/to/context.md
```

When creating a new maintenance section, prefer a `Context maintenance` heading,
followed by the adoption marker, then maintenance instructions. Preserve existing
equivalent sections and marker positions; do not rearrange them solely for
formatting consistency.

Use the actual context entry point, relative to that instruction file; a README
section is also valid. For new adoption, use the current date. Preserve an existing
adoption date and equivalent marker rather than adding another. When adding a
marker to previously adopted guidance, use a supported original date or `unknown`
if none is recorded; do not invent the history. If equivalent maintenance guidance
and context already exist, add only the missing marker. Preserve the guidance's
wording; a missing marker alone is not a reason to reinitialize or rewrite it.
Update the entry point only when its canonical location changes. Do not mark
incomplete setup as adopted or add a marker during an audit-only request. Existing
projects without markers may still follow the method; the marker records adoption,
not document accuracy or freshness.

Review the marker and its target along with the final diff. Report changes,
verification and unresolved questions, including whether ongoing guidance and
the marker were added, reused or remain incomplete.
